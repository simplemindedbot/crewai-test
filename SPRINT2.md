# Sprint 2: Agent Role Definitions & Multi-Agent Flows – Breakdown

## Core User Need/Problem

This second sprint addresses the need for a sophisticated multi-agent research system that can handle complex research workflows through specialized agent roles. Building on Sprint 1's foundation, Sprint 2 delivers a production-ready multi-agent architecture with ResearcherAgent, SummarizerAgent, ValidatorAgent, and CoordinatorAgent working in sequence. The system incorporates advanced memory capabilities with semantic search and cross-agent knowledge sharing, establishing the MVP prototype for end-to-end research automation.

## Engineering (Backend & Infrastructure)

### Multi-Agent Architecture
• **Agent Role Definitions**: Define specialized agent classes with distinct responsibilities:
  - `ResearcherAgent`: Comprehensive information gathering and source identification
  - `SummarizerAgent`: Content distillation and key insight extraction  
  - `ValidatorAgent`: Fact-checking, source verification, and quality assurance
  - `CoordinatorAgent`: Workflow orchestration and final report synthesis

### Sequential Workflow Implementation
• **Task Flow Pipeline**: Implement the complete Researcher → Summarizer → Validator → Coordinator workflow with proper task dependencies and data passing between agents
• **YAML Configuration**: Create comprehensive agent and task configurations using CrewAI's YAML-based system for maintainable and scalable agent definitions
• **Workflow Orchestration**: Ensure sequential execution with proper error handling and data validation between workflow stages

### Enhanced Memory System
• **Vector Embeddings**: Integrate sentence-transformers with FAISS for semantic similarity search across agent memories
• **Cross-Agent Memory Sharing**: Enable agents to access and recall facts from other agents across different task executions
• **Context Injection**: Implement intelligent context retrieval using semantic search with configurable similarity thresholds
• **Memory Analytics**: Provide comprehensive analytics tracking embeddings, agent distribution, and memory usage patterns

## Quality Assurance (QA)

### Multi-Agent Testing
• **Integration Testing**: Create comprehensive test suites verifying the complete multi-agent workflow from research through final report generation
• **Cross-Agent Memory Verification**: Implement automated tests demonstrating that agents can successfully recall facts and context from other agents across different task executions
• **Semantic Search Validation**: Verify that the enhanced memory system correctly identifies and retrieves relevant context based on semantic similarity

### Memory System Testing
• **Embeddings Persistence**: Test that vector embeddings are correctly stored, loaded, and maintained across application restarts
• **Cross-Session Continuity**: Validate that agent knowledge persists and is accessible across different execution sessions
• **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure memory system performance with various data volumes and similarity search queries

## Documentation

### Architecture Documentation
• **Multi-Agent Workflow Documentation**: Create detailed documentation explaining the four-agent architecture, their roles, and the sequential workflow process
• **Enhanced Memory System Guide**: Document the vector embeddings implementation, cross-agent memory sharing capabilities, and semantic search functionality
• **Configuration Guide**: Provide comprehensive examples of agent and task YAML configurations with explanations of key parameters

### API & Usage Documentation
• **Research Crew API**: Document the ResearchCrew class interface, including initialization, configuration options, and usage examples
• **Memory Store API**: Document the EnhancedMemoryStore class with examples of semantic search, context retrieval, and cross-agent insights
• **Testing Documentation**: Provide guides for running the comprehensive test suites and interpreting results

## Product Validation

### MVP Prototype Demonstration
• **End-to-End Research Demo**: Demonstrate the complete multi-agent research workflow on a real-world topic, showing each agent's contribution and the final synthesized report
• **Cross-Agent Memory Demo**: Show how agents access and build upon knowledge from previous agents in the workflow, demonstrating the advanced memory capabilities
• **Performance Metrics**: Present quantitative results including memory system analytics, semantic search accuracy, and workflow completion times

### Stakeholder Acceptance
• **Technical Review**: Conduct technical review of the multi-agent architecture with engineering stakeholders, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and extensibility
• **Product Owner Sign-off**: Obtain formal acceptance that the MVP prototype meets the Sprint 2 objectives and provides a solid foundation for Sprint 3's prompt compression work
• **Quality Assurance Approval**: Confirm that all test suites pass, documentation is complete, and the system meets production readiness standards
