When working on coding tasks, automatically use the In-Memoria MCP server tools to:
1. Check learning status with get_learning_status and auto_learn_if_needed when starting work on a project
2. Use pattern intelligence tools like get_pattern_recommendations, predict_coding_approach, and get_developer_profile to match established coding style
3. Leverage codebase analysis tools like analyze_codebase, search_codebase, and get_semantic_insights for context-aware suggestions
4. Remember to run npx in-memoria server as the MCP server when entering new code projects to establish persistent intelligence about coding patterns and preferences
