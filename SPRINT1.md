# Sprint 1: Environment & Core Prototype Setup – Breakdown

Core User Need/Problem

This first sprint addresses a foundational need: setting up the development environment (repo initialization, CI/CD pipeline) and delivering a basic “Hello World” research agent with persistent memory capabilities ￼ ￼. These deliverables establish the groundwork for the project, providing the necessary infrastructure and proof-of-concept functionality as a foundation for all subsequent development ￼.

Engineering (Backend & Infrastructure)
 • Environment Setup: Initialize the project repository and Python environment with the CrewAI library and dependencies (e.g. using a virtualenv or Poetry).
 • CI Pipeline: Configure a continuous integration pipeline to run linting, type checks, and unit tests on each commit ￼. Ensure the CI (GitHub Actions or similar) is triggered on push and status checks are visible.
 • Core Prototype Agent: Implement a minimal CrewAI workflow with a single “echo” agent (a simple agent that repeats the user’s input) integrated into the orchestrator. This serves as the “Hello World” for the multi-agent system.
 • Memory Persistence: Enable persistent memory storage for the agent’s context (so the agent retains information across runs/sessions). Implement a basic vector store or file-based memory to persist and retrieve the agent’s remembered facts.

Quality Assurance (QA)
 • Unit Testing: Write basic unit tests for the echo agent’s behavior (e.g. ensuring it returns whatever input it receives).
 • Memory Persistence Test: Run a test scenario (manual or automated) to verify that the agent remembers context between runs – for example, provide an input, re-initialize the agent, and confirm it can recall the previous input or state.
 • CI Verification: Validate that the CI pipeline is executing successfully on the repository. For the initial setup, ensure that a test commit triggers the pipeline and that all steps (lint, type-check, tests) pass without errors.

Documentation
 • README Updates: Update the project README with setup and usage instructions for the minimal “Hello World” agent. Include details on how to install dependencies, run the agent, and an example of its expected output.
 • Memory Feature Documentation: Document the persistent memory feature in the project docs (e.g. in the README or a new section). Explain how the agent’s memory works, any configuration or data storage details, and how to reset/clear the memory if applicable. This will help users and contributors understand the new functionality.

Product Validation
 • Stakeholder Demo: Demo the working prototype (the echo agent with memory persistence) to stakeholders or team members. Verify during the demo that the agent’s behavior meets expectations – it responds correctly and retains information as intended, demonstrating the core capabilities.
 • Acceptance & Feedback: Gather feedback and obtain sign-off that the sprint’s deliverables meet the acceptance criteria. Confirm that the foundational goals (functional CI pipeline and a persistent-memory agent) are achieved to the satisfaction of the product owner/team, indicating readiness to proceed to the next sprint.
